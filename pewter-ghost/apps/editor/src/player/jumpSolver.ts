/**
 * Frame-accurate jump solver — finds the REAL maximum jump distance by
 * searching the actual input space, instead of deriving it from continuous
 * kinematics.
 *
 * See the fork's JUMP_SOLVER_REWORK_PLAN.md (PartyD1/Pewter-The-Platformer @ b36ff59) for the full rationale. The short version:
 * the old closed-form `calculateMaxGap()` under-reported by 1.3–2.0 tiles
 * because it modelled a continuous world with no coyote time and no body
 * width. Pewter's real physics is a discrete frame loop with a 10×14px AABB,
 * and the longest jumps are taken by running *off* the ledge and jumping on
 * the last coyote frame.
 *
 * This module simulates that loop verbatim (importing the same
 * `stepMovement` the live controller uses) and sweeps:
 *   - sub-pixel takeoff phase (where in the frame you reach the ledge)
 *   - jump frame (including every coyote frame past the ledge)
 *   - jump hold duration (matters under ceilings and for rising targets)
 * at 30/60/144fps, reporting the worst case across all three so a jump that
 * qualifies works on every machine.
 *
 * Difficulty is expressed as **jump-timing latitude**: how many milliseconds
 * of slop the player gets on the jump press. That is the number the tiers are
 * built on, and it is what makes "hard level" a definition rather than a
 * feeling.
 *
 * Pure and Phaser-free so it can be unit-tested (see ./jumpSolver.test.ts).
